**Paul's Software Portfolio Website**

1. Languages used to build website:
	- HTML, CSS, and Javascript

2. The goal for build a portfolio website
   	- Show off coding skills, career experience, previous projects, and a way for people to contact me

3. Challenges and entertaining tasks
	- I enjoyed creating a responsive website that will be able to be viewed on desktops as well as mobile phones. A little challenging, but very fun and a great lesson.
